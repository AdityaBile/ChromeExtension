          Dear Epic Users, our encrypted proxy / VPN over the past ten years
          without fail has protected us on over a trillion website visits. It's
          gotten expensive to operate our network which is powered by 100s of
          servers around the world, and we've been facing security challenges
          due to attacks and bot abuse. In order to maintain the robust
          performance and security of the proxy network, we need to store &
          analyze some anonymized data but never any IP or personal information.
          We work with third parties to both power and analyze our network and
          its usage e.g. the encrypted proxy / VPN servers that we exclusively
          operate are hosted by third party data centers around the world. The
          excellent news is that our encrypted proxy network will continue to be
          free, fast and robust, and that we welcome four more countries into
          our network! Please read our terms & conditions and privacy policy for
          more detailed information.
